#### In the Beginning ... Eve
* **Soteriology**: The study of religious doctrines of salvation
* Moore claims that the two creation accounts tell different stories, but it seems clear to me that the second simply has more detail about the creation of humans and the first focuses on bringing order to the elements.

## Quiz Questions

1. How does Moore interpret Eve as a narrative of gender equality?
	First, Moore correctly points out that the first 3 chapters of genesis serve primarily to diagnose the cause of human imperfection and our fallen condition (what Moore refers to as etiology) while also demonstrating the need for a savior (soteriology). Moore observes that nothing in the first two chapters exalts or privileges one gender over another and that Genesis 3, while it does make prescriptions about how men and women relate, has been interpreted in ways that do not necessarily reflect the original intent of the ancient authors.

	While many subsequent interpreters have cast a great deal of blame on the woman for partaking of the fruit, the text itself is more nuanced. Moore raises an interesting point that I am not sure she fully realized. It was Adam's passivity and neglect to husband his wife (to lead her), that lead to her being vulnerable to the serpent's temptation. After all, Adam's weakness in refusing to take responsibility for the actions of his wife is a prominent feature of the text, which has historically been interpreted as weakness. Perhaps then, in Genesis 3, God declaring that the man would rule over her was not a punishment of the woman, but a recognition of the failures of the man. (The teachings from Paul that Moore cites reflect this view)

	In summary, the Eve narrative is meant to focus on the need for a savior and man's fallen condition. The text itself does not emphasize a gender narrative, but inasmuch as the temptation narrative highlights the differences between the sexes, it serves to show that the current relationship between man and woman reflects a disordered, fallen condition, and according to Moore, that God's original plan for the sexes was much more equal.

2. How does Moore interpret Eve as a narrative of gender hierarchy?
	On page 5 of pdf:
	Genesis 1 : Male and Female created together, jointly given dominion over the world
	Genesis 2 : Sex complementarity (Eve created as an help fit or worthy of Adam)
	Genesis 3 : Sex polarity (which seems to justify women's subordinate role)

	Moore is making the implicit assumption that that the Lord's observations are prescriptions rather than observations.

	It is also possible, that as in all mortal, human endeavors, there must be an agent capable of making a final decision. Thus God's command for the man to rule over the women is mercy being shown on them both, in preparation for a dangerous world, in need of strong leadership. In this light, the relation between the sexes is deemphasized and the fallen world and need for a savior is emphasized.
