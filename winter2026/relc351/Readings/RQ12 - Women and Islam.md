1. How is the hijab a symbol of female liberation in Islam?
	# Imam Mahoui
	"freedom that allows you to go uncovered is the same freedom that allows me to choose to cover"

	"As a result, those who choose to cover their hair and dress modestly have become the most easily recognizable members of the Islamic faith and therefore are the targets of the most criticism. "
	* No, I think the criticism is directed at islam and islamic leaders, especially militant leaders. 1979 Iranian revolution, for example.
	Although such an environment may pose its own set of obstacles—such as the stigma around Muslim women who choose not to wear hijab—these stories shed light on what it means to practice your religion in a place where your religious expressions are not necessarily welcome.

	Yet, it is not the cloth that oppresses a woman, but rather the ignorant mind that judges her by what is on her head rather than what is in it. 
	* What you wear on your head is symbolic of what is in your head among other things

	Muslim women who have been “forced” to wear the hijab are the ones taking away women’s freedom of choice.
	* She is assigning motivations that do not exist, liberation of muslim women is only a pretence of the hijab bans
	Difference is good. Difference is inspiring. Difference is empowering. Difference is what makes each and every human being beautiful.
	* Difference is not an inherent good

	But hijab is not scary, nor is it a symbol of terrorism or religious extremism. 
	* It quite literally is scary and extreme, you cannot just declare that isn't so
	The following stories about hijab remind us that hijab isn’t just about what you’re wearing; it’s about your way of life

## Rowaida
* Journalist
* Being Muslim will always find its way back to you. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but once you realize how visible you are, it takes some adjustment.

2. How is the hijab a principle of female suppression in Islam?
# Sara
* "hijab is extremely difficult, and every hijabi wrestles with it in her own way. I think about how ironic it is that while there are tyrants working to eradicate Islam completely, Muslims are bickering about how exactly one should wear the hijab"
* I also went to a Khutbah recently in which the speaker equated a Muslim woman taking off her hijab to someone earning interest off of money. My blood was boiling, and I left feeling exactly the opposite of how one is supposed to feel when departing the masjid
* I have my own opinions about the hijab, and they have changed radically over the years, but wearing it is an act between myself and my Lord
* But at the same time, I do not think that hijab is one of our five pillars of Islam.

# Adwaa
* It still seemed too restrictive for me, and I didn’t think it was something I could practice
* 31 year old cousin dies in car crash
* I finally understood at my core how misguided that was. I decided this would be the year I focused on my spirituality and my relationship with Allah.
3. Can the same principles of physical modesty be applied equally to men and women? Why or why not?
	Obviously not. But plainness does apply to both men and women
# Shamaas
* If you look beyond this definition, you’ll gain insight into hijab’s true significance. The word itself translates to “barrier” in classical Arabic. The idea of hijab is to be a barrier for a woman to shield her beauty from unwelcoming eyes. Why is it that only women have to shield their beauty from men? Why must a woman cover up while a man can do as he wishes?
* But there is a hijab for men, too. It doesn’t involve them covering their hair, but it does require them to cover themselves modestly like anyone else. Often our understanding of modesty has been limited to women, but our tradition teaches us modesty is for both men and women. This is apparent in the statement of the Prophet (PBUH) “Modesty is good in its entirety.
4. Is fashion (clothing) an essential part of religion?
	Sara said "But at the same time, I do not think that hijab is one of our five pillars of Islam."

# Shabnam
* I feel safer wearing the hijab. I think this is partially because I am doing what God has asked me to do, and I feel protected by His great power.
* Criticized Muslims for having others remove the hijab out of fear
* Sometimes I blame my hijab for my being excluded in social situations, for not getting a job, or for not feeling beautiful.
* Although these are the beliefs behind my choice to wear hijab, daily insecurities taint my experience. I cannot help but imagine that life would be easier without a piece of fabric around my head. So yes, I think about taking the hijab off. Even though it is a personal choice, I often have to justify it to strangers.

# Jana
* Kind of just a bunch of slogans

# Ruma
* Didn't want to wear it
* Started to wear it
* Said it was liberating
# Hala
At the time, all immigrants had to first apply for a green card before traveling to their next
destination. I had recently put on the hijab and loved it deeply. The immigration officers in
New York asked me to remove my hijab for my green card photo, but I adamantly refused.
They kept repeating that I would not be able to move or board my next flight until I took the
photo. Eventually they even threatened to revoke my immigration status and send me back to
Syria unless I removed my hijab. But I steadfastly refused, saying I would rather obey God and
forget about my immigration. I loved the hijab that much.
