Religion Theory and Methodology 1:
![[Reading 2.pdf]]

1. Within the principles of Religious Studies developed by Kant, Husserl, Otto and Eliade, is it more effective to see God as Noumenon or Phenomenon?
	Distinction between Noumenon and Phenomenon drawn by Kant on Page 46 (11 of the pdf)
	* Noumena: things as they are in themselves
	* Phenomena: things as they appear to us
2. Is "bracketing" justifiable in Religious Studies?
	Bracketing
	* Husserl's proposed method of systematically studying subjective phenomena (page 49 or 14 in the pdf)
	* We should not ask what is real or true beyond our experience (we put those questions in brackets ie ignore them for the purpose of religious study), instead we pay careful attention to what appears to us or what is described to us
3. Marx and Eliade both argue that religion and technology are incompatible. Are they correct?; whose argument is more persuasive?
	* 
4. Is Max Muller's assertion that "he who knows one knows none," clear, coherent, and credible?
	* Page 52 (17 of the pdf)
	* Max Muller's assertion is intuitive. Many missionaries I have spoken with have told me that they never understood english until they learned Spanish. Only by studying the mechanisms of another language, did they have the context to understand the mechanism of their own.
