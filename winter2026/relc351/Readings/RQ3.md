Tyler (53 thru 56 or 18 thru 21):
* Primitive Culture
* Applying evolutionary theory to cultures
* Survivals
* Animism: "seeing everything that moves as having *anima*, a soul or spirit that animates it"
* Apparently the simplest structure is the most advanced (not darwinian evolution) neither his presupposition that more advanced religions start and end in the same places.
	* I would critique his point that the Christian God (a triune God who needed to sacrifice His Son, who is He, in order to save the world from the abstraction He calls sin) is actually simpler than polytheistic Gods with much simpler, relatable motivations. In fact, Christian monotheism indeed evolved in the sense that it was much more complex than the previous polytheistic religions that preceeded it.
Frazer (56 thru 59 or 21 thru 24):
* Early stages of human development were magic **Very particular meaning here
* Evolution of magic (ex incantations or sympatheic magic) to religion (prayers, pleadings with a God) to science
* Theory that Jesus came from the corn king ritual: Clearly ridiculous, being buring is the "death" Jesus referred to, not some esoteric story about grain. It is not a survival. Perhaps it is a coincidence, but it is a strained one at that.
Geertz:
* Beliefs religion a feature of cultures, not a step on the evolution towards science
* Thick Descriptions
* Religions at the heart of culture
* You can make the case that, in his estimation, religion is capable about answering questions about how we relate to life (which science is incapable of answering)


Mary Douglas:
* Clean vs Dirty as ordered vs disordered, requires things belong to classes

William James:
* Communicating with the DIvine would require unique mental abilities that might be able to be cultivated
	* Seems similar to the idea of growing in your ability to recognize the Holy Ghost
* Mystical Experiences:
	1. ineffable (cannot be described to those who have not also experienced them)
	2. noetic
	3. transient
	4. passive
* The twice born as a way of escaping dread and despair
* Religious Experiences "among the most important biological functions of mankind"

Freud:
* Unconscious vs conscious part of mind
* religious belief is what we want to be true, not what we have found to be true. That is, religion comes from the unconscious mind
* *In Totem and Taboo* speculates on the origin of religion

Durkheim:
* Founder of Sociology
* Religion is essentially social
* Totemism: the earliest and simplest religion
* Totem: an animal with which a tribe identifies
* We focus on group identity through rituals
* The Sacred: The realm of the social where people are concerned with the common good
* Religious orients us in society, thus loss of religion can lead to alienation and suicide, chaos mentioned on page 69
* Religion is irreplaceable in promoting group solidarity: unity or agreement of feeling or action, especially among individuals with a common interest; mutual support within a group:
* Key developer in modernization theory


Weber:
3 ideal types of leader:
1. magician
2. priest
3. prophet

* The connection between capistalism and protestantism
* Protestant Ethnic (page 70)
* Secularization Thesis (page 71)

Berger:
* Social Construction of reality
* Thinking cannot be independent of our social context
* Language: vehicle through which meaning is portrayed
* Knowledge: Communities of meaning, arising through language, which people share



1. From the theories of Tyler, Frazer, and Geertz, are contemporary religions more evolutionary similar or distinct from ancient (primitive) religions?
	Contemporary religions are more evolutionarily distinct than primitive religions, but only in a very superficial sense of the word "evolutionary." The analogy of Darwinian evolution as applied to religion breaks down when one considers the very real possibility that religion did not arise from magic (sympathetic religion, Shamans, et cetera), but that the magician (as weber characterized him) is a cheap imitation of the priest or prophet. We know that the "primitive religions" did not simply die off due to "natural selection," as an evolutionary theory might predict, because the pagans were contemporary to Moses in the Old Testament, the Christians of the New, and are still evident today: we still have Shaman, false healers, Wickens, et cetera. Given the permanence of these "primitive religions" and "contemporary religion" in the modern day, we may reasonably assume that the aspects of 

	Contemporary religion and primitive religion are distinct, persistent phenomena that have coexisted and influenced each other, but not in a strict evolutionary sense.

2. Are current religious practices more a response to chaos than evil?; explain
	Religion practices are more a response to chaos than evil, and inasmuch as they are a response to evil, it is only because evil is a manifestation of chaos. All questions of truth have moral implications, so if something is wrong, it is a moral imperative to remedy it, or at least discontinue the disordered behavior. Where Douglas goes wrong is in her assumption that the classification of phenomena is arbitrary.
	
3. Nearly 100 years later, are modernization/secularization theses (Durkheim, Weber, Berger) more or less credible?; explain
	While I agree with the prescription that religions that require a public profile are backward, I do believe that his observation that Weber's secularization thesis is an outstanding predictor of modern, rational societies. The more educated people are (in the modern sense of education), the more likely they are to view religion as a private matter and separate their secular life from their religious devotion. It is precisely this disassociation which I believe breaks down social solidarity and causes people to yearn (whether they know it or not) for the community-oriented aspects of religion: cultic ritual observance, a sense of belonging, and the belief your neighbor is trustworthy.

4. What are the totems of today's religions as described by Freud and Durkheim?; explain
	Christianity:
	* The cross
	* A dove (symbolizing pacifist, Christian denominations)
	* The Bible
	* A particular denomination (the Catholics, Seventh-day Adventists, Lutherans, et cetera form clear, distinctive communities with rites and initiations unique to each and exclusive of the other)

	Islam:
	* 

	Latter-day Saints
	* Perhaps the particular tribe of Israel
	* Israelite vs gentile
	* The pioneers
	* Joseph Smith
