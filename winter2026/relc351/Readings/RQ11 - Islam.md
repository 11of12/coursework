2. Quran 49: 14, "say not, you have believe, but rather say, we have submitted." Why does Islam make this distinction? What does it mean in comparison to Judaism and Christianity?
	
	"All human beings are called upon to submit to the will of God by establishing justice. In doing so, they will be following the din, the term used by the Qur’an to summarize the core of the monotheistic tradition." Page 1

	s we saw, the Qur’an focuses on belief that is demonstrated in actions. In the Qur’an’s worldview, the divine origin of all creatures is to be reflected in the way people treat one another. There is only one God, and that God created all human beings. All people are equal in the sight of God, and the human challenge is to create a society that reflects the equality all people share in the eyes of their Creator. This is the reason human beings were created – as we saw, to be “stewards” of God’s creation. And this is the basis upon which human beings will be judged. Two terms are important here: intention and effort. The Qur’an promises reward for those who submit to the divine will, and punishment for those who reject it.

However, every person must make the intention (niyyah) and the effort (jihad).
