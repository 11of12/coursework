Which depiction of Mary, the Mother of God, is most relevant for Christianity today, Radford-Ruether or Pope Francis? explain.

The depiction of Mary, the Mother of God, most relevant for Christianity today is that of Pope Francis. This is because Pope Francis taught spiritual truths that can strengthen religious conviction, while Ruether denigrates and trivializes the example of Mary in an anti-religious way that limits the spiritual lessons that can be gleaned from her example and contributes to the spiritual dangers unique to the modern era.

Francis's teaching "salvation came forth {through a woman} and thus there is no salvation without a woman" teaches us that women, in child-rearing, are doing something miraculous. This is relevant in a world that sees pregnancy as a passive act - something that happens to you, not something that you do. Francis's teaching is that pregnancy is an active act that the mother, through her body, engages in. Additionally, Francis's elaboration that "humanity’s salvation came forth from the body of a woman: we can understand our degree of humanity by how we treat a woman’s body," has relevance to modern issues such as pornography and sexual expression. 

In contrast, Ruether's conclusion is that pregnancy is simply a passive act, which does not warrant praise, "she is praised not for what she does or thinks, but for what she lets happen to her – becoming pregnant with Jesus – and for what she does not do – have sex." Thus, Ruether teaches the opposite, damaging messages that women should not be praised for their roles in giving life to newborn babes and that chastity is not a venerable virtue.




1. In Christianity, is valorizing Mary, the Mother of God, an essential part of valuing women? Why or why not?
	The virgin conception initiated the "nuptial" union of God and mankind

	I am not the first to draw a connection between Mary the Mother of God and Mother in Heaven. Nephi seemed to do so when interpreting his fathers vision of the tree of life. Thus, Heavenly Mother has an essential role in providing our salvation through Jesus and we praise this Divine Feminine through the veneration of May of Nazareth.
	
	 From her, a woman, salvation came forth and thus there is no salvation without a woman.
	The Pope engaged in this same type of generalization "The rebirth of humanity began from a woman. Women are sources of life."
	

2. Can one believe in the bible without falling into "spiritual infantilism?"
	The Bible teaches of a Father God, or at least uses imagery of a father and son interaction to describe His relationship with mankind (such as a Father giving good gifts to His children). So the question may be rephrase, "Can one believe that they have a parent-child relationship to God without falling into 'spiritual infantislism.'" While "infantilism" literally means "childish behavior," Radford Ruether used the word to describe how adherents of a religion treat each other, "they make adults treat themselves and other adults as children."
