1. How does the text change if it is approached as the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament?
	Page 2 of the pdf
	Page 17: "Until the 18th century, all Jews were what we would today call Orthodox. They believed that the entire Torah was revealed by God in just the words we have now, so that whatever it says is literally true. They followed the rules in the Mosaic law and lived apart from Christians in Europe."
	
	At the end of the day, we all develop some form of commentary on the Bible that is more authoritative (whether we admit it or not) than it.
2. Who has the best argument for the founder of Judaism; Adam, Abraham, or Moses? Explain
	Page 26: "Yet the core teaching of Judaism from ancient times to the present remains that the people of Israel were chosen by God to be “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” God established a covenant with Abraham and renewed it with Moses at Sinai, and the “people of Israel” – Jews – are bound by it today."
3. Is tribalism an essential foundation of religion? Why or why not?
	
4. Do Jewish prohibitions improve the Sabbath? Why and why not?
