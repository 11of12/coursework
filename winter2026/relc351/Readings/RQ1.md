1. How has Ferdinand de Saussure's theories changed how religion is defined. Is this a positive of negative change?
	(On Page 2)
	* "did not engage religion directly, but his work on symbolic linguistics had a great effect on many terms, including religion."
	* Correctly identifies that "langauge is a complex mechanism that cannot be changed at will," but also concludes that language has a tendency to evolve, and thus, the definitions of religion and key concepts therein must also evolve. This point of view foregoes the possibility of a static, universal definition of religion and thus makes it difficult for academics to agree about the object of their study.
	* An example of a lexical definition
	* While necessary, lexical definitions are certainly not definitive, when it comes to the academic engagement of terms like religion(s).

	(according to professor) A process of continuos evolution based on immutatable strucutres. Will evolve by several predictable patterns. 

2. If only one could be chosen, which functional stipulative definitions are more useful for academic inquiry, irreducible or reductionist definitions? How would that choice change the understanding of religion?
	Functional-stipulative Definitions (on page 3)
	* "Functional-stipulative definitions are also called operational definitions and they allow for theorists and scholars, and even ecclesial leaders and devotees, to assert a definition of religion for a specific purpose or context." Page3
	* Two distinct categories
		1. Irreducible
			* "academic positions that allow room for the transcendent."
			* This definition opens the doors of analysis to the numinous and mysterious and closes it to those who deny such things. Rudolf Otto contended In his work “The Idea of the Holy,” that "if they could not agree that they had super-rational encounters with the holy, there was no point for them to read the rest of book."
			* It is possible that this rational exclusivity is a feature of this type of analysis. Perhaps conversations about religion and its terms must be had by those open to the possibility of the divine and mysterious in order to bear any fruit at all.
		2. Reductionist
			* Karl Marx reduced religion as an expression of the oppressed necessitated by economic injustice (Negative religion is the resutl of economic oppression). (Page 4)
			* Sigmund Freud reduced religion to individual and collective neuroses, based on infantile wish fulfillment and the basic human need to control the uncontrollable (Negative: Religion is the result of human failing or shortcoming).
			* "Emile Durkheim provides a more positive reduction of religion. He argued that religion exists, perpetuates, and evolves as a system to sanctify and order communities. Religion plays essential social roles"
		
	
3. Re-write herbert of cherbury's 5 tents of religion for the mto be more relevant for today.
		(From page 6 of the text)
	5 essential characteristics (common notions) of religion:
	1. there is one God, (There is only on correct religion)
	2. God ought to be worshipped, (The one true religion is the one that people should believe and follow)
	3. virtue is the central human pursuit, (Self control, excellence, and generally being a good person constitute the purpose of life)
	4. people should repent of their sins (People need to feel a sense of shame and a desire to change when they commit evil actions)
	5. There are rewards and punishments in the afterlife. (There is more than just this life, and our actions will lead to consequences outside of what is inflicted by our own mortal conscience and earthly powers: while you can escape many earthly consequences for your actions, there are consequences beyond this world that are equally real)
	
4. Describe what each of Brux linocms quadrants of religions looks like in your own religious beliefs. does his quadrants effectively define the key characteristics of your religious experiences
	(Page 6)
	1. A discourse: 
		The Book of Mormon, being both of divine origin, divine purpose (the keystone of the religion), and containing the word of the Divine, would certainly qualify as a discourse in this framework. Similarly, fantastical stories around Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, subsequent prophets and their accompanying authority to discern doctrine are elements of the discourse quadrant that distinguish the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from other self-described Christians.
	2. Practices:
		Some ethical practices include: paying tithing, caring for the power, abstaining from extramarital and disordered sexual practices, and showing respect and concern for authoritative leaders. This ethical practices are not very useful in distinguishing our faith from other Christian faiths, but some ethical practices are distinctive because of their peculiarity: abstinence from coffee and tea, for example, is a particular ethical practice unique to the Church of Jesus Christ. This example from the word of wisdom, might be considered a minimalist practice (or potentially a minimalist discourse) by some members of the church who do not see the dietary restriction against coffee and tea as morally relevant for those outside of the Church. Interestingly, within the Church of Jesus Christ we would likely identify the use of illicit drugs for selfish reasons as a maximal ethical practice, which is morally relevant to those outside of the faith. 

		More distinctive than our ethical practices are our ritualistic practices: the mode of administering Priesthood Blessings, the temple ceremonies, the concept of an individual convenant (as opposed to a Sacrament), et cetera, as defined by our discourse is distinctly different from the equivalents that exist in other religions. For example, while baptism is present in other Christian faiths, our discourse defines baptism as the first in a series of Covenants that raise the status of a member of God's kingdom closer and closer towards divinity (often referred to as the "covenant path") is absent in other religions. It is not merely the practice of baptism, but the definition of sanctifying ordinances and the doctrine of eternal progression that make our mode of baptism dinstinctive.
		
	3. Community:
		Family history fosters a sense of familial community, 
		Elder's Quorum, Relief Society, 

	4. Institution:
		Buearacratic elements might include Area Presidents, church office workers, potentially governing Bishops who focus on the distribution of church funds more than religious teaching.

		Ecclesial elements include the apostles, Bishops, missionaries, et cetera, who have been given authority in their respective domains to intepret (and even declare) scripture. Importantly, many of the offices that I have delineated fulfill a buearacratic and ecclesial role such as the apostles, governing bishops, area presidents and bishops. Each of these offices ....
