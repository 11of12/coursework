####  Preliminary Considerations: Why Study Women and World Religion (1-3)?
* Looks at the religious experience of women as a separate category from the religious experience of men
* How can they be sexist if they only focus on the experiences of men? It seems that they also focus on women, but the author just doesn't like the way in which the traditions focus on women.
* Page 2 makes an error: it equates subordinate positions as viewed as less valuable
* **Sexist:** "Privileges men and male experiences as superior and devalues and denigrates those of women as inferior." (I take issue with this because there is a parallel drawn between Mary the Mother of God and Zechariah, the father of Jesus's cousin John, yet Mary's experience is applauded and Zechariah's is denounced. Even Mary's role as Mother of God is viewed as vastly more important than the priestly duties ascribed to Zechariah)

* **Gender Differentiation**: Viewing gender as a way of categorizing different aspects of experience in a dualistic manner, associating certain attributes or aspects as "female" and others as "male," with the former signifying what is inferior and the latter what is superior
* **Gender Segregation**: Divide religious activities and experiences on the basis of gender
* **Gender Ideology**: Naturalizes ideas of how men and women both are and ought to be, ideas that develop out of cultures, but which are legitimated as part of divine law or God's will
* Not to belabor the point, but if gender segregation is instructing women to perform tasks that it does not instruct men to do, it does focus on the female experience: it is just that Peach views these tasks as not as fulfilling as the male oriented tasks that she also acknowledges. Strangely, it is a sort of damned if you do, damned if you don't critique. If you ignore the "female experience" by not requiring leadership roles, priestly rites, et cetera of women she will accuse you of sexism, but if you require certain things (like ceremonial washing), of women, Peach will regard it (of her own declaration) as inferior to the priestly washings and then say that you are oppressing women, and making them do things that men are not required to do.

* Another reason, is to focus on status of men vs women
#### Similarities and Differences In Women's Experience
<u>Similarities</u>:
* Males considered primary, women considered secondary (or inferior)
* Dominant Relgious Symbols are Male Gendered
* Men predominate as leaders (in well organized religions)
* Male gendered language to refer to God
* Men only interpretting religious texts
<u>Differences</u>:
* fsd

# Questions
1. Why focus on women in a world religions course?
	According to Peach, what we typically regard as the teachings and practices of individual religions, are primarily the result of men told with respect to the "male experience" at the exclusion of the "female experience." By narrowing the scope of our analysis to gender-based doctrine and the "female experience" we are likely to uncover overlooked aspects of religious observance and view the assumptions and practices of many religions much more critically.

2. Is Peach correct that all "world religions" are androcentric, patriarchal, and sexist?
	Her argument that "world religions" are patriarchal (meaning that they are ruled by fathers or that the primary religious rulers are male) is undeniably true, without much need for debate. 

	Her claims of androcentrism (religion is centered on the "male experience") and sexism (religion exalts and privileges men over women) are much more suspect. Peach takes a disingenuous position in which she looks disapprovingly on religions that focus exclusively on the "male experience" by giving specific, exclusive responsibilities to men. However, when those same religions give specific, exclusive responsibilities to women (such as ceremonial washings, instructions to be submissive to their husbands, et cetera) they do not seem to "count," because in Peach's estimation, they are inferior roles to men. It is important to note that Peach is implicitly assuming that these roles are inferior, when the religions in question do not usually make that same value judgement. In fact, often these religions, especially Christianity, exalt the passive, feminine roles, sometimes above the priestly, masculine duties.

4. Can the roles of men and women in "world religions" be equal and complementary?
	The roles of men and women in "world religions" can be equal and complementary, but not according to any definition of equal that will be satisfactory to Peach. I, personally, do not like using the word "equal" to describe men and women because their complementary roles are so far removed, that it is difficult to compare them. For example, is it better that children are physically protected (a primarily male responsibility) or emotionally cared for (primarily a female responsibility). The question of equality, even when restricting the word to mean absolute value or worth or something just doesn't seem to make sense. 

	From Peach's point of view, equality is probably closer to the word "same." For example, she views women being exluded from the authoritative interpretation of scripture as an obvious bad thing. In her view, it seems that any complementary role that does not lead to a women also contributing to the interpretation of scripture as ever being equal.
