Craig Martin Capitalizing Religion / Marx Today
1. Quietism (not publically expressing religious devotion / principles)
2. Individualism (Believing that one sabbath observance is good for you but not holding others to the same standard, kind of the opposite of maximalism)
3. Productivity (Rarely critiqued by religion)
4. Consumerism (Rarely critiqued by religion)

^ These are the "third rails" of maximalist structures in religion

Sacred space and pilgrimage

The more quietist and individual you are, the less evangelical you are (the less mission oriented)

Islam is much more evangelically effective because it is not quietism or individualism

The angel and the behive by Armon Moss, talks about the pendulum swing of culture. The church swings back and forth between the angel and the beehive. Two types of Church culture: peculiarity based on church charism: sacred rituals, golden plates, et cetera (the angel) and then the beehive is politeness, family values, (the industrialness or the values).
