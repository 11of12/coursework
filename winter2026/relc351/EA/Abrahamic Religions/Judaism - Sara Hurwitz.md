Speechwriter for the Obamas

Had a conservative, religious, Jewish upbringing. She was disillusioned in her youth. She was raised to be proud of being Jewish and follow the customs because "that's just what we do as Jews." "I had a vague sense that something was missing." At a certain point she was proud to be Jewish by identified as an atheist. 

I was dating a guy, broke up, and was lonely, bored and anxious. Got an email about an intro to Judaism class. She just wanted something to do. 

She found the intellectual exploration of spiritual and ethical ideas as filling the missing hole. "I cannot believe that this had been here and I didn't know." "Over the course of various calsses, I just thought this is extraordinary"

5:10 (Building a fence around the Torah)

"I didn't need judaism to be a good person, but I needed it to be a great person"

American law is designed so that I dont steal or infringe of someones rights, but it is not designed to ensure that I am honest, generous, lving, kind, fair, and good I don't want American law doing that. It was almsot like the Torah was saying "Sarah we saw you doing this the other day and don't do it"

"I was casually cruel with my language"

"That ethic of being very careful of your words" (which is taught in the Torah)

I think that the distinction between manners or ethics is the specificity

8:41 story about man talking bad about his Rabbi and the feathers

How did you confront this whole notion of "what it means to be faithful (avoiding hell) and to be obedient"
* I reject that even more now
* Once you go down that road of "there is a God who controls everything and rewards and punishes you as you deserve - there is a lot of mental gymnastics to justify something which I see as disproven every hour of every day so I reject the idea that there is a being who rewards and punishes us as we deserve - that is a really tough theology.
* There are a lot of Jewish concepts of the divine and that opened up doors for her
* We choose to be Jewish
* We are interpretive tradition. We don't live by the original version of the Torah any more than Americans live by the original version of the constitution - thank goodness Both those documents allowed slavery, but we reimagined them to get rid of the epitome of evil

How do you relate to these (genocidal) aspects of the texts?
* Like the constitution, you must reinterpret them
* Its not a perfect system, we have to use our human hearts and minds to reinterpret these documents in a kind, and loving, and decent way
* The core ideas of america have a lot to do with equality and liverty, but if are laws are failing those principles, then we need to reinterpret our documents

Having come to the reality of Judaism, I am just more filled with wonder and awe in my daily life.

The first words of morning prayers are "i am grateful"
