# Process Customization

**Capstone Principle**: You have freedom to choose the design activities to best accomplish your project.

Project Elements:
* Scope
* Schedule
* Resources


"pencils down" or "shoot the engineers"

What benefits will your team receive if scope, schedule, and resources are aligned correctly

schedule = scope / resources

minimal viable product

Major checklist for completed project
* Measured performance values
* market response to the product

Design
* Refined definition for the entire system
* Complete bill of materials (including SBOM)

Is the design package sufficient to allow a third party (someone not associated with capstone) to correctly deliver the product and test its compliance with specifications
-> This is literally the criteria for "transferability"

# Engineering Impact Through Faith and Reason
Guest Speaker: Christopher A. Mattson

How can I strengthen my integration of Faith and Reason?

How can I prepare to transition out of BYU into a professional experience based on Faith and Reason

Part 1: Engineering Design


Part 2: An Added Dimension

# Faith and Reason
It takes a lot of faith to create something that has never existed before
It also takes a serious amount of intellectual reasoning
