Last semester have 3 design reviews: Requirements, Concept, Detailed

Winter Semester: 3 Reviews (4 if you count the Winter Plan Review)
* Build and Test Review NLT March 5
* Final Manager Review/Design Package Presentation with Instructor (NLT Apr 1)
* Final Spaonsor Review / ....

Build/ Test Revieew
* Need test results from working fucntion prototype
* Every key requirements doesn't to be fully met yet, but must actually work somewhat
* One more

Dr. Lunt:
# Planning
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail

Design Outcomes
Design Activities
Relationships between activities
* Independent 
* Dependent
* Interdependent

# Risk
Inherent to every human activity

* Financial
* Part wear out / failures
* Poor dsign
* Accidents / disaster
* Deliberate

*Risk management*
* Identify, evalutation, and prioritization of risk
	* Failer modes and effects analysis
	* 
* Coordination ...


Inherently Safe Design
* Potneital hazards eliminated
* Low energy reactions, low temperature, low voltage, fireproof
* protected moving parts

Safety reserves
* Stronger than needed
* Include large safety factors

Safe fail
* When design fails, it does so without causing harm
* e.g., Subway "dead man" switch

Safeguards
* Components add to prevent portential harm
* ...

Procedural Safeguards
* Procedures and training to minimize harm
* e.g. driver's license

Market Risk
* Perhaps the market won't want to purchase your "perfect" new product*
* Desirable

Technical Risk
* lkjdsf
* Desirable

Distribution Risk
* Tesla is good at innovation but at a certain time they couldn't meet market demand
* Transferrable

Societal Risk
* Product failures can take lives

1. Risk identification and mitigation is natural part of good design
2. Systematic mitigation approaches catch otherwise unforeseen risks
3. Things don't always work out, so have backup solutions
4. Products are not always used in ideal conditions, so test the extremes
5. Benign change to one part of the product can negatively affect another part, so make changes carefully
6. An honest evaluation of risk is difficult, but necessary


# Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
Dr. Nordin

Failure Modes: The way that it fails. Not the cause or the effect, but the way it fails.
Effects: What might happen if the failure mode occurs
Analysis: The analysis also includes identifying causes

## Fault Tree Analysis
Another available formal tool
