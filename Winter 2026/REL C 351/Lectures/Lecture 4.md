Advantage of getting EA's in before due date, is the grace period can be used to put in even higher scores

The expectation of the course is to "rip these things (the readings) apart"

Class Discussion
The best way to optimize the religious experience for men and women is to view these categories as complementary. The gender / sex categories exist and are immutable realities, so they cannot be ignored for the purposes of any organization that claims to have a fulness of truth. Total segregation ignores the fact that humans are coupling creatures and interactions between the sexes are necessary for spiritual and practical reasons. For example, marriage serves a practical purpose (procreation) as well as a spiritual purpose (companionship, service, temperance, self-control, chastity, et cetera). So, the only valid way to optimize religious experience is to view the sexes as complementary.

A couple of caveats:

If equality means "sameness" or elimination of the category's male and female for the purpose of religious experience, then it cannot be equal. If we change the definition of equality, then it might be possible.

Limited segregation can be beneficial and even optimize the religious experiences of men and women, but it must be the exception and not the rule. In general, religious principles must apply to both sexes, otherwise the religious experience of one sex will dominate that of the other. But for the most unique aspects of men and women, segregation can enhance their unique spiritual gifts such as the gift of nurturing for women in organizations like the Relief Society and the gift of the priesthood in Elder's Quorum for men.
