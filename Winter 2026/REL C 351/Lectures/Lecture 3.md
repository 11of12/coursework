Review:
Totems: Freud identifies that there are these conseptual ideas that are foundational and central to religious belief
Durkheim develops this to be the center of the narrative trope or a physical object

Durkheim Today:
* Suicide (Published on suicide before publishing on religion)
	* Altruistic
	* Fatalistic
	* Egoistic (Lost all human connection or support)
	* Anomic (The idea of the self in comparison to the situation)
* Veterans
	* Solutions based on egoistic theory failed
	* Could this be anomic?
	* No justification to kill or commit other anomic acts? You remember
* Transgender
	*
