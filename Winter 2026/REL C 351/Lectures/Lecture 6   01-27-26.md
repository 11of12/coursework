Review of the RQ:

The Broken Heart by Bruce Hafen, a great book on the Temple

If we want to learn how to do acts of independence, we can learn from Eve, Adam on the other hand has a dependent, deflective response

Adam tries to enter the cycle while preserving some of his righteousness and Eve says that she is fully culpable.
