# Video 1: Can you prove the existence of God?
* Most religions argue for a supreme force, who is not anthorpomorphic (the uncaused cause, the thing that started the big bang)
* "When I was 5 or 6 I said that this can't be true", "when I was 7 or 8 I though you had to be an agnostic"
* Belief in God seems to be fundamental to human existence, but she is open to the idea that in 1000 years we have "moved past belief in God"
* She claims that she does not know whether God exists, "most of our creation seems very culture bound and it couldn't exist like that"
* Intrigued by facing the universe without a belief in God, it might help you find out "what it means to be human" Leads to a "very interesting" "loneliness, precariousness, hollowness, or echo"

# Video 2: What is the most important task for the teacher of religion today?
* Perry-White model of cognitive development
* She prides herself on taking her students past a "black and white, I'm right, you're wrong model" to the next stage "you're right, I'm right, we all have our own truths" and it is much harder to take them to "multiple valid ways of looking at the same thing, but I need to stake out a set of guidelines ... to guide my life and to generate leadership... {academics in theology hasn't modelled this very well }"
* "In a world of diversity you can still have a theological enterprise talking about the nature, the validity, the promise, the importance of a christian God. And they haven't figured out how to do that without making absolute claims that seem to relatavise and diminish the claims around them and I would say that is the most important job for the CHurch... it might take them 150 years" "We're all sort of waiting on it"

# Video 3: What interests you most as a scholar?
* The long term questions (as you take on projects you get clearer about)
* The short term questions (define a particular project)
* "Very interested in the body language of piety (some of the new age religions have brought that back)"
* Using religion to gain wealth "its not religion at its most uplifting...and yet if there are any essential moments in religion, it is piety or improving my physical situation"
* She observes that many religious scholars avoid this discussion

# Video 4: How do you see women participating in scholarly work in religion?
* Women cross-culturally are working to become more indvolved in religion. Catholic women's work is helping tibeten budhhist, which in turn, helps certain forms of Hinduism. 
* In order to define a place for yourself in a tradition, you have to grant the tradition limits. (You have to avoid trying to overthrow the tradition in order to have a place in it)

* On the other hand, women in the study of religion
* "When I entered grad school women were uncommon, but quickly became common"
* "The men were so hard on the male student (a patriarchal system of dumping on the male students). Women were "unimportant" which gave them freedom to pursue whatever they wanted to pursue."
* "I have ultimately had a career that has not have been hampered by being a women"

# Video 5: How do you explain death as a meaningful reality?
* "Whatever it is it might not need us to believe in it"
* "Death is contrary to our will and probably one of the great tamers of our will"
* "Death brings a sense of connectedness to all other living creatures in ways that my human hubris had never allowed me before"
* "I get a comfort from that sense of being part of lots of things being born and dieing"
* "I haven't yet learned how to translate that into intellectual question to bring into my study of religion"

# Video 6: How do you define religion?
* "I was raised by scholars who thought that it was very important to have a definition of religion on the table as a methodological point of clarity"
* "When I went to study chinese material, I found that definitions got in the way a bit and you needed to suspend some of the defining a bit"
* I have a working defiintion but I don't take it too seriously
* "Ideas, convictions, and practices related to the sense of a reality other than the quotidian (the day to day)"
* "I down play the language of some great divide between the sacred and the profane (which Eliade recognized)"
* SUMMARY FROM THE VIDEO SUMMARY: She suggests that “religion” is a 21st century term and that it is often not useful when applied to many Asian or emerging religions.
* For 85% of the cases it is belief in divine beings, but not for the others
* You have to have a looser notion in order to work with those others
* In china, only after the missionaries have been there for a long time would the natives say that maybe they hve a "religion" but not anything like western religion, so I guess we are irreligious

# Video 7: Would people be religious if they were never going to die?
* "Reminded me of the importance of the emergence of the study of religion (not theology). Early anthropologists of religion took thinking about death as the starting point (like anism and coming up with explanations of ghosts and spirits)"
* Theology takes it a different way, interaction with our own mortality as being the catalyst
* One of the things of Buddhism that makes it qualify as a religion. The woman that comes to the buddha about her dead child. "She can't be dead. She can't be. Go to every household where no one has died and find 1 grain of rice. There is no household where no one has died. Then she could accept her dead child."
* "At the same time, I think we might be religious if we had no death... I was a little bit beguiled with other things that I see as real commonalities in religion - the desire for healing...the desire to improve our station or wealth ... we might have the desire to identify the sources that we can interact with, rituals (attending shrines, maximizing good luck)"

# Video 8: How do you deal with “the problem of evil”?
* "It's a hard one and we back off from it"
* "Is religion implicated in violence"
* "After 9 11 people blamed monotheism" "Other religions that are not monotheistic have also had their share of violence"
* "Is religion intrinsically able to promote violence? Clearly religion could be one of the ways to work ourselves out of violence" "It might be a way to mobilize people to go to war or to not go to war"
* ""
* "I don't know what evil is really"

# Video 9: What do you say to people who claim all religions are the same?
* Does looking too much at similarities cause you to lose something important?
* Does looking too much at the differences cause you to lose something important?
* There's enough commonalities that we feel we can talk about  religions?
* Her friend said "You don't know any religions if you know only one" yet there is amazing variation

# Video 10: What lead you to your present academic interest?
* Raised catholic (mother converted for father's sake, who was very critical)
* Wanted to study what people believe (religion), not how a few people think we should believe (philosophy)
* Chinese language opened up whole new cosmology enabled her to reflect back on the judeo-christian tradition

# Video 11: Who would you identify as having a significant influence on your career?
* Sister Adele Fisk, reminded of tibetan monk, first truly intelectual woman, who saw all religious question not as feeling but as a true avenue into intelectual engagement. She did it with a casualness that I was quite enamored of. Studies he style.

# Video 12: How do you talk about the relationship of science and belief?
* One of her larger project is "how to talk about belief"
* Would like to break out of the mold of "rationalists vs irrationalist" or "science vs believers" in order to get at the larger question of belief
* 

# Video 13: **What is your primary interest as a scholar?**
* Folk religion: as opposed how people make sense of their religion, it is how the leaders tidy up their religions and make them into refined systems
* Grant them a pride of place next to Aquinas
* My interest in ritual is "lets get out of the intellectual and focus on what people do"

# Video 14: How do you imagine language as a problem in ritual expression?
* "There is something in the human heart which wants to chant ... wants to speak with words not limited to a tight meaning"

# Video 15: Do you have a final comment?
* "Why do we ask the quesntion we do
* What counts as knowledge
* What counts as knowing something about religion
* What is a text?
*
