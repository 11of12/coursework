1. How did the early Christian councils develop Christian doctrine?
	Early Christian councils develop Christian doctrine by convening many Christian leader and voting / discussing what the doctrine is. These councils gained legitimacy through political enforcement.

	In the early centuries (1st and 2nd AD), there was "no orthodoxy in Christian thought." This diversity of doctrine required a remedy.

	The presbyter, Arius of Alexandria believed that Jesus had been created by God, but his view was literally outvoted at the council of Nicea

	Page 9:
	"Christianity, its basic literature and doctrines newly established, became the state religion of the Roman empire in 380. That meant that it was central to the government’s legitimacy; its leaders approved of the government and acceptance of its official teachings became the measure of full membership in the Roman state. Those who did not accept official Christian teaching were not only excluded from the rights of citizenship; because they did not accept the state ideology, they were considered politically suspect – possibly traitors. This politicization of Christianity marked the beginning of anti-Jewish sentiment discussed above."

2. Does the Orthodox (Eastern) or Catholic (Western) Church have a better claim to apostolic succession through Peter? Why?

	"Eastern Christians did not have a central authority. They organized regionally, resulting in a strong connection between the religious leaders, the national political leader, and the national language. This bond is reflected in the names"
	
2. Why did popular (folk religion) movements develop in early Christianity?

3. Was the Christian reformation a positive development? Why and why not?
	Many will try to point out that the reformation refuted false doctrines and practices such as the sale of indulgences and infant baptism. First of all, the sale of indulgences is based on the true principle that the Church has the authority to forgive sins. To the point of infant baptism, it is true that the practice is abhorrent in the sight of God. Equally abhorrent is Calvin's assertion that even the most innocent babe is polluted in the sight of God and therefore deserving of hellfire. So in many cases, the reformation will at best reject suspect practices and the true principles behind those practices, and at worst the protestants reject suspect practices while maintaining or even doubling down on the false doctrine on which they are based. All this at the cost of unity in the faith.
