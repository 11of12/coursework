	Korzenik
	* Oldest woman in the US to become a Rabbi
	* Unlike her male counterparts who entered the rabbinite early in life, she had friends
	* Story of the young doctor asking her to officiate at her wedding, then asking if a man could co-officiate
	* During a Bar Mitzvah in Cracow, an american rabbi attempted to physically stop her from commentating on the Torah 
	* Not wanted in 15-century remu synagogue
	
	Hausman: 
	* Doesn't recall inequality from the professors, though there were difficulties accomdating women
	* Does recall sexit comments from men such as fears that women would take their jobs
	* Accuses men who leave the temple after women hired as making them scapegoats for their back dues.
	* Her students came to associate cantors with women because of Hausman
	* Some of the places that she applied to specifically chose to hire a man in order to avoid controversy over hiring a woman.
	* Some places specifically looked for a woman in order to enrich their congregation.
	* Concludes that sex should not be a factor (positive or negative ) in hiring
3. Judith Plaskow calls for a reinterpretation of Jewish history that takes women seriously. What would that look like?
	Whatever it would look like, it wouldn't look like Judaism anymore.
