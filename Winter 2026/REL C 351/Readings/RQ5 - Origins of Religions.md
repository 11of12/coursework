#### Intro

The following are recurring subjects in the origins of religion
#### Death and Dreams

#### States of Consciousness

#### Celestial Objects: Sun, Moon, Planets, and Stars

#### Anthropomorphism and Agent Detection

#### Theisms

1. How does death motivate and influence religious beliefs?; How has death shaped your beliefs?
	The text seems to think that it is the process of seeing a difference between a living body and a corpse and trying to determine the difference that eventually evolves into the idea of what animates the body - the soul, and where the soul goes that leads to idea of eternal abodes, ghosts, immortality, et cetera. However, the actual evolution is much simpler: grief and fear get you to the conclusion of immortal souls far more quickly than this evolutionary theory. All religions believe in a transcendent soul, because all humans struggle to reconcile loss.

2. Can any altered state of consciousness be spiritually/religiously efficacious?
	For both heaven and hell. As a Christian, I have to believe this because the dream state has been used by God to give his followers visions throughout history. However, I do not need to rely on the legitimacy of Christianity to make this observation. We all dream, and in dreams we are much more willing to suspend reality and accept supernatural phenomena. In fact, it is this suspension of disbelief that allows a dreamer to have the faith necessary to believe what the Divine might reveal.

	While it is true that drugs and alcohol can have similar effects on the body through alterations of ones physical state which consequently affects the mind, the difference between this approach and dreams is that the user enters into this altered state of consciousness through a immoral means. This is dangerous because central to the mind will be immorality, which is subject to be enhanced by the suspension of disbelief. A Christian would say that the drug user entered into his delusion in a state of Sin and thus is cut off from God and the devil can use the altered state of consciousness to his advantage.
	
3. Does anthropomorphism and agent detection limit human comprehension of the divine?
	Inasmuch as there are transcendent aspects to the divine, we will only be able to comprehend them by likening those aspects to human characteristics. Take the idea of justice for example. Justice seems like a transcendent principle, yet it is really hard to define without appealing to human actions and behaviors. God is just because He "gives people what they are owed," or He "balances the scales." One might imagine a more abstract description of justice, God is "an agent who enacts retributory corrections to states of moral entropy," but at this point the definition is so abstract and pedantic that most mere mortals would reinterpret it with analogies and anthropomorphisms before attempting to understand what it means. This means, that we can only understand Divine principles in anthropomorphic ways. Thus anthropomorphism enables us to understand the divine, rather than inhibiting us. In fact, it might even suggest that if the Divine is going to exist, then it must be an agent. 

4. Have religious beliefs progressively from animism, to polytheism, to monotheism?
	In a general sense (meaning with some exceptions), this pattern is applicable to world religions, but it has not been a natural, evolutionary path for any of them.

	It is not clear to me that polytheistic religions naturally evolved to become more monotheistic. Ancient Judaism, which is often marred as polytheistic (meaning it was open to the idea of the existence of several ineffectual gods inferior to their own), is at least more monotheistic then a religion that promotes praying to Saints and Angels to effectuate change (I mean this with a great deal of respect toward the Catholics, I myself believe in at least 3 Gods, likely more). More likely than a natural evolution from polytheism to monotheism, it seems one group determine that it was logically sound for religion to have one supreme entity so other religions, convinced by the logic of this view, had to subjugate all their gods to one, usually incorporeal being, without losing the substance of having several gods in practice.
